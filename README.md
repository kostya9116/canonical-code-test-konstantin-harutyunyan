# Blog App - Konstantin Harutyunyan

This repository contains two versions of a simple blog app, implemented in both ReactJS and Vanilla JavaScript. The app fetches blog posts from an external API and renders them on the page.

## Project Structure

- VanillaJS: This folder contains the Vanilla JavaScript implementation of the blog app.

Each folder is a self-contained application. Follow the README within each directory for instructions on how to run each application.
